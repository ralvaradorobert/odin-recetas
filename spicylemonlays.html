    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've been eating spicy lemon lays since I was a youngling. 
        My mom would always prepare them and share them with me. Very hard to resist! </p>

        <p>Preparing them is simple! Simply put whatever amount of Lays 
        potato chips you want to eat into a bowl. Put as much Tapatio 
        as you'd like, but beware because it can be spicy. And lastly,
        cut open a lemon and use a lemon squeezer to squeeze the juice
        over the lemon lays. Try not to use more than one, so it does 
        not mask the spiciness of the Tapatio. </p>

        <p>And Voila! You're done!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Potato Chips (Lays work best)</li>
                <li>Lemon or Lime</li>
                <li>Tapatio sauce (can also use Valentina or Cholula)</li>
            </ul>
